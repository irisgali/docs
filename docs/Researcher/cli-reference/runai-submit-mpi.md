Syntax notes:

- Options with value type of stringArray mean that you can add multiple values. You can either separate values with a comma or add the flag twice.

## Examples

start an unattended mpi training job of name dist1, based on project _team-a_ using a _quickstart-distributed_ image:

    runai submit-mpi dist1 --processes=2 -g 1 \
        -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart-distributed

(see: [distributed training Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-distributed-training.md)).

## Options

<job-name\> the name of the job.

### Aliases and Shortcuts

--interactive

> Mark this Job as Interactive. Interactive jobs are not terminated automatically by the system.

--template string

> Templates are currently not supported.

### Container Related

--always-pull-image stringArray (deprecated)

> Deprecated. Please use `image-pull-policy=always` instead.
> When starting a container, always pull the image from the registry, even if the image is cached on the running node. This is useful when you are re-saving updates to the image using the same tag, but may incur a penalty of performance degradation on job start.

--args stringArray

> Arguments to pass to the command running on container start. Use together with `--command`.

> Example: `--command sleep --args 10000` .

--attach

> Default is false. If set to true, wait for the Pod to start running. When the pod starts running, attach to the Pod. The flag is equivalent to the command [runai attach](runai-attach.md).

> The --attach flag also sets `--tty` and `--stdin` to true.

--command stringArray

> Command to run at container start. Use together with `--args`.

> Example: `--command script.py --args 10000`

-e stringArray | --environment stringArray

> Define environment variables to be set in the container. To set multiple values add the flag multiple times (`-e BATCH_SIZE=50 -e LEARNING_RATE=0.2`) or separate by a comma (`-e BATCH_SIZE:50,LEARNING_RATE:0.2`).

--image string | -i string

> Image to use when creating the container for this Job

--image-pull-policy string

> Pulling policy of the image When starting a container. Options are:

> - `always` (default): force image pulling to check whether local image already exists. If the image already exists locally and has the same digest, then the image will not be downloaded.

> - `ifNotPresent`: the image is pulled only if it is not already present locally.

> - `never`: the image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image.

> For more information see Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/#container-images).

--local-image (deprecated)

> Deprecated. Please use `image-pull-policy=never` instead.
> Use a local image for this job. A local image is an image which exists on all local servers of the Kubernetes Cluster.

--stdin

> Keep stdin open for the container(s) in the pod, even if nothing is attached.

-t, --tty

> Allocate a pseudo-TTY

--working-dir string

> Starts the container with the specified directory as the current directory.

### Resource Allocation

--cpu double

> CPU units to allocate for the job (0.5, 1, .etc). The Job will receive **at least** this amount of CPU. Note that the Job will **not** be scheduled unless the system can guarantee this amount of CPUs to the job.

--cpu-limit double

> Limitations on the number of CPU consumed by the job (0.5, 1, .etc). The system guarantees that this Job will not be able to consume more than this amount of GPUs.

--gpu double | -g double

> Number of GPUs to allocate to the Job. The default is no allocated GPUs. the GPU value can be an integer or a fraction between 0 and 1.

--large-shm

> Mount a large /dev/shm device. An _shm_ is a shared file system mounted on RAM.

--memory string

> CPU memory to allocate for this job (1G, 20M, .etc). The Job will receive **at least** this amount of memory. Note that the Job will **not** be scheduled unless the system can guarantee this amount of memory to the job.

--memory-limit string

> CPU memory to allocate for this job (1G, 20M, .etc). The system guarantees that this Job will not be able to consume more than this amount of memory. The Job will receive an error when trying to allocate more memory than this limit.

### Storage

--pvc `[Storage_Class_Name]:Size:Container_Mount_Path:[ro]`

--pvc `Pvc_Name:Container_Mount_Path:[ro]`

> Mount a persistent volume claim into a container.
>
> The 2 syntax types of this command are mutually exclusive. You can either use the first or second form, but not a mixture of both.

> **Storage_Class_Name** is a storage class name which can be obtained by running `kubectl get storageclasses.storage.k8s.io`. This parameter may be omitted if there is a single storage class in the system, or you are using the default storage class.

> **Size** is the volume size you want to allocate. See [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) for how to specify volume sizes

> **Container_Mount_Path**. A path internal to the container where the storage will be mounted

> **Pvc_Name**. The name of a pre-existing [Persistent Volume Claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#dynamic) to mount into the container
>
> Examples:

> `--pvc :3Gi:/tmp/john:ro` - Allocate `3GB` from the default Storage class. Mount it to `/tmp/john` as read-only

> `--pvc my-storage:3Gi:/tmp/john:ro` - Allocate `3GB` from the `my-storage` storage class. Mount it to /tmp/john as read-only

> `--pvc :3Gi:/tmp/john` - Allocate `3GB` from the default storage class. Mount it to `/tmp/john` as read-write

> `--pvc my-pvc:/tmp/john` - Use a Persistent Volume Claim named `my-pvc`. Mount it to `/tmp/john` as read-write

> `--pvc my-pvc-2:/tmp/john:ro` - Use a Persistent Volume Claim named `my-pvc-2`. Mount it to `/tmp/john` as read-only

--volume stringArray | -v stringArray

> Volume to mount into the container. Example `-v /raid/public/john/data:/root/data:ro` The flag may optionally be suffixed with `:ro` or `:rw` to mount the volumes in read-only or read-write mode, respectively.

### Network

--host-ipc

> Use the host's _ipc_ namespace. Controls whether the pod containers can share the host IPC namespace. IPC (POSIX/SysV IPC) namespace provides separation of named shared memory segments, semaphores and message queues.
> Shared memory segments are used to accelerate inter-process communication at memory speed, rather than through pipes or through the network stack.
>
> For further information see [docker run reference]("https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/") documentation.

--host-network

> Use the host's networkstack inside the container.
> For further information see [docker run reference]("https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/")documentation.

### Job Lifecycle

--processes int

> Number of distributed training processes. The default is 1.

### Access Control

--create-home-dir

> Create a temporary home directory for the user in the container. Data saved in this directory will not be saved when the container exits. The flag is set by default to true when the --run-as-user flag is used, and false if not.

--prevent-privilege-escalation

> Prevent the jobâ€™s container and all launched processes from gaining additional privileges after the job starts. Default is `false`. For more information see [Privilege Escalation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#privilege-escalation).

--run-as-user

> Run in the context of the current user running the Run:AI command rather than the root user. While the default container user is _root_ (same as in Docker), this command allows you to submit a job running under your Linux user. This would manifest itself in access to operating system resources, in the owner of new folders created under shared directories etc.

### Scheduling

--node-type string

> Allows defining specific Nodes (machines) or a group of Nodes on which the workload will run. To use this feature your administrator will need to label nodes as explained here: [Limit a Workload to a Specific Node Group](../../Administrator/Researcher-Setup/limit-to-node-group.md).
> This flag can be used in conjunction with Project-based affinity. In this case, the flag is used to refine the list of allowable node groups set in the project. For more information see: [Working with Projects](../../Administrator/Admin-User-Interface-Setup/Working-with-Projects.md).

### Global Flags

--loglevel (string)

> Set the logging level. One of: debug|info|warn|error (default "info")

--project | -p (string)

> Specify the project to which the command applies. Run:AI Projects are used by the scheduler to calculate resource eligibility. By default, commands apply to the default project. To change the default project use `runai project set <project-name>`.

--help | -h

> Show help text

--generate-name

> Generate auto increment suffix to the job name in case the requested name is already in use

## Output

The command will attempt to submit an _mpi_ job. You can follow up on the job by running `runai list` or `runai get job-name`
