## Examples

All examples assume a Run:AI project has been set using ``runai project set <project-name>``.

Start an interactive job:

    runai submit --name build1 -i python -g 1 --interactive --command sleep --args infinity 

(see: [build Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-build.md)).

Externalize ports:

    runai submit --name build-remote -i rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd:14.04 --interactive \
        --command "/usr/sbin/sshd" --args "-D" --service-type=nodeport --port 30022:22

(see: [build with ports Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-build-ports.md)).

Start a Training job

    runai submit --name train1 -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 1 
    
(see: [training Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-train.md)).

Use GPU Fractions

    runai submit --name frac05 -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 0.5 

(see: [GPU fractions Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-fractions.md)).

Hyperparameter Optimization

    runai submit --name hpo1 -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/walkthrough-hpo -g 1  \
        --parallelism 3 --completions 12 -v /nfs/john/hpo:/hpo 

(see: [hyperparameter optimization Quickstart](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-hpo.md)).

Auto generating job name

    runai submit -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 1 
    
Auto generating job name with defined prefix and incremental index suffix

    runai submit --job-name-prefix -i gcr.io/run-ai-demo/quickstart -g 1 

## Options

### Aliases and Shortcuts

--name
> The name of the job.

--interactive
>  Mark this Job as Interactive. Interactive jobs are not terminated automatically by the system.

--jupyter
>  Shortcut for running a Jupyter notebook container. Uses a pre-created image and a default notebook configuration. 

> Example:

> ``runai submit --name jup1 --jupyter -g 0.5 --service-type=ingress`` will start an interactive session named jup1 and use an ingress load balancer to connect to it. The output of the command is an access token for the notebook. Run ``runai list`` to find the URL for the notebook.

--template string
>  Templates are currently not supported.

--job-name-prefix
> The prefix to use when auto generating names with incremental index.

### Container Related

--always-pull-image stringArray (deprecated)
>  Deprecated. Please use `image-pull-policy=always` instead.
>  When starting a container, always pull the image from the registry, even if the image is cached on the running node. This is useful when you are re-saving updates to the image using the same tag, but may incur a penalty of performance degradation on job start. 

--args stringArray
>  Arguments to pass to the command running on container start. Use together with ``--command``.  

>  Example: `--command script.py --args 10000`

--attach                        
>  Default is false. If set to true, wait for the Pod to start running. When the pod starts running, attach to the Pod. The flag is equivalent to the command [runai attach](runai-attach.md). 

> The --attach flag also sets ``--tty`` and ``--stdin`` to true. 

--command stringArray
>  Command to run at container start. Use together with ``--args``.

>  Example: `--command script.py --args 10000` 

-e stringArray | --environment stringArray
>  Define environment variables to be set in the container. To set multiple values add the flag multiple times (``-e BATCH_SIZE=50 -e LEARNING_RATE=0.2``) or separate by a comma (``-e BATCH_SIZE:50,LEARNING_RATE:0.2``)

--image string | -i string
>  Image to use when creating the container for this Job

--image-pull-policy string
>  Pulling policy of the image When starting a container. Options are: 

> - ``always`` (default): force image pulling to check whether local image already exists. If the image already exists locally and has the same digest, then the image will not be downloaded. 

>  - ``ifNotPresent``: the image is pulled only if it is not already present locally.

>  - ``never``: the image is assumed to exist locally. No attempt is made to pull the image.

> For more information see Kubernetes [documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/#container-images).

--local-image (deprecated)
>  Deprecated. Please use `image-pull-policy=never` instead.
>  Use a local image for this job. A local image is an image that exists on all local servers of the Kubernetes Cluster. 

--stdin
>  Keep stdin open for the container(s) in the pod, even if nothing is attached.

-t, --tty
>  Allocate a pseudo-TTY.

--working-dir string
>  Starts the container with the specified directory as the current directory.

### Resource Allocation

--cpu double
> CPU units to allocate for the job (0.5, 1, .etc). The Job will receive __at least__ this amount of CPU. Note that the Job will __not__ be scheduled unless the system can guarantee this amount of CPUs to the job.

--cpu-limit double
> Limitations on the number of CPU consumed by the job (0.5, 1, .etc). The system guarantees that this Job will not be able to consume more than this amount of GPUs.

--gpu double | -g double
> Number of GPUs to allocate to the Job. The default is no allocated GPUs. the GPU value can be an integer or a fraction between 0 and 1.

--large-shm
> Mount a large /dev/shm device. An _shm_ is a shared file system mounted on RAM.

--memory string
>  CPU memory to allocate for this job (1G, 20M, .etc). The Job will receive __at least__ this amount of memory. Note that the Job will __not__ be scheduled unless the system can guarantee this amount of memory to the job.

--memory-limit string
>  CPU memory to allocate for this job (1G, 20M, .etc). The system guarantees that this Job will not be able to consume more than this amount of memory. The Job will receive an error when trying to allocate more memory than this limit.

### Storage

--pvc `[Storage_Class_Name]:Size:Container_Mount_Path:[ro]`

--pvc `Pvc_Name:Container_Mount_Path:[ro]`

> Mount a persistent volume claim of Network Attached Storage into a container.
>
> The 2 syntax types of this command are mutually exclusive. You can either use the first or second form, but not a mixture of both.

> __Storage_Class_Name__ is a storage class name which can be obtained by running ``kubectl get storageclasses.storage.k8s.io``. This parameter may be omitted if there is a single storage class in the system, or you are using the default storage class. 

>    __Size__ is the volume size you want to allocate. See [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) for how to specify volume sizes

>    __Container_Mount_Path__. A path internal to the container where the storage will be mounted

>    __Pvc_Name__. The name of a pre-existing [Persistent Volume Claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#dynamic) to mount into the container
> 
> Examples:

> ``--pvc :3Gi:/tmp/john:ro``  - Allocate `3GB` from the default Storage class. Mount it to `/tmp/john` as read-only 

> ``--pvc my-storage:3Gi:/tmp/john:ro``  - Allocate `3GB` from the `my-storage` storage class. Mount it to /tmp/john as read-only 

> ``--pvc :3Gi:/tmp/john`` - Allocate `3GB` from the default storage class. Mount it to `/tmp/john` as read-write 

> ``--pvc my-pvc:/tmp/john`` - Use a Persistent Volume Claim named `my-pvc`. Mount it to `/tmp/john` as read-write 

> ``--pvc my-pvc-2:/tmp/john:ro`` - Use a Persistent Volume Claim named `my-pvc-2`. Mount it to `/tmp/john` as read-only


--volume stringArray | -v stringArray
>  Volume to mount into the container. Example ``-v /raid/public/john/data:/root/data:ro`` The flag may optionally be suffixed with ``:ro`` or ``:rw`` to mount the volumes in read-only or read-write mode, respectively.


### Network

--host-ipc
>  Use the host's ipc namespace. Controls whether the pod containers can share the host IPC namespace. IPC (POSIX/SysV IPC) namespace provides separation of named shared memory segments, semaphores and message queues.
> Shared memory segments are used to accelerate inter-process communication at memory speed, rather than through pipes or through the network stack.
> 
> For further information see [docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/").


--host-network
>  Use the host's network stack inside the container.
> For further information see [docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/").


--port stringArray
>  Expose ports from the Job container. Used together with ``--service-type``.  
>  Examples:  
>    ``--port 8080:80 --service-type loadbalancer``

>    ``--port 8080 --service-type ingress``

--service-type string | -s string
>  Service exposure method for interactive Job. Options are: ``portforward``, ``loadbalancer``, ``nodeport``, ingress.
>  Use the command runai list to obtain the endpoint to use the service when the job is running. Different service methods have different endpoint structure.


### Job Lifecycle

--backoffLimit int
> The number of times the job will be retried before failing. The default is 6. This flag will only work with training workloads (when the ``--interactive`` flag is not specified).

--completions int
>  The number of successful pods required for this job to be completed. Used for [Hyperparameter optimization](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-hpo.md). Use together with ``--parallelism``.

--parallelism int
> The number of pods this job tries to run in parallel at any time.  Used for [Hyperparameter optimization](../Walkthroughs/walkthrough-hpo.md). Use together with ``--completions``.

--ttl-after-finish duration
>  Define the duration, post job finish, after which the job is automatically deleted (5s, 2m, 3h, etc).  
> Note: This setting must first be enabled at the cluster level. See [Automatically Delete Jobs After Job Finish](../Scheduling/auto-delete-jobs.md).


### Access Control

--create-home-dir
> Create a temporary home directory for the user in the container. Data saved in this directory will not be saved when the container exits. The flag is set by default to true when the --run-as-user flag is used, and false if not.

--prevent-privilege-escalation
> Prevent the job’s container and all launched processes from gaining additional privileges after the job starts. Default is ``false``. For more information see [Privilege Escalation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#privilege-escalation).

--run-as-user
>  Run in the context of the current user running the Run:AI command rather than the root user. While the default container user is _root_ (same as in Docker), this command allows you to submit a job running under your Linux user. This would manifest itself in access to operating system resources, in the owner of new folders created under shared directories etc.


### Scheduling

--elastic
> Mark the job as elastic. For further information on Elasticity see [Elasticity Dynamically Stretch Compress Jobs According to GPU Availability](../researcher-library/rl-elasticity.md).

--node-type string
>  Allows defining specific nodes (machines) or a group of nodes on which the workload will run. To use this feature your administrator will need to label nodes as explained here: [Limit a Workload to a Specific Node Group](../../Administrator/Researcher-Setup/limit-to-node-group.md).
> This flag can be used in conjunction with Project-based affinity. In this case, the flag is used to refine the list of allowable node groups set in the project. For more information see: [Working with Projects](../../Administrator/Admin-User-Interface-Setup/Working-with-Projects.md).

--preemptible
>  Mark an interactive job as preemptible. Preemptible jobs can be scheduled above guaranteed quota but may be reclaimed at any time.


### Global Flags

--loglevel (string)
>  Set the logging level. One of: debug|info|warn|error (default "info").

--project | -p (string)
>  Specify the project to which the command applies. Run:AI Projects are used by the scheduler to calculate resource eligibility. By default, commands apply to the default project. To change the default project use ``runai project set <project-name>``.

--help | -h
>  Show help text.

## Output

The command will attempt to submit a job. You can follow up on the job by running ``runai list`` or ``runai get job-name -e``

Note that the submit call may use templates to provide defaults to any of the above flags.
